    h2 JavaScript will..
  ul
    li #[b not go away!]
    li be even more popular, because it's the safest language to learn
    li be faster and faster (V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra) + HTTP/2 server push and pipelining
    li always improve thanks to #[b TC3] group and great OpenSource community
    li be used for mobile app development (React Native, Vue Native etc.)
    li be used for back-end development with #[b TypeScript]
    li be used with WebAssembly for game development (Rust)
    li modules will be supported natively by all browsers
      |

    li take over the World!
