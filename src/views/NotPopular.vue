    h2 JavaScript Was Not Popular, Because..
  ul
    li it has many built in WTFs
    li it didn't provide many functions for working with arrays, objects etc.
    li it was not cross-browser compatible
    li after Backbone.js was released, there were frameworks poping up on daily basis (2010+)
    li working with DOM is a mess
    li every company wanted to have SPA, but there were no good tools provided
    li it is asynchronous and working with async code ain't no easy
    li people thought that JavaScript is good only for form validations
